                        <h3>Q125, Q150, Q175 Line Boring Systems - with drill base adapter:</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Made in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Our equipment is the easiest and most economical way to rebore holes round and concentric again. One year warranty against defects in American craftsmanship.The Q125S, Q150 and Q175 setups include everything you need for reboring most holes. It is intended for repairing holes up to 8 inch diameter in heavy construction equipment such as cranes, backhoes, endloaders, excavators and tractors powered by your variable speed magnetic drill press with a 3/4 inch drill chuck. It can also be used to rebore holes in machinery frames, steel mill ladles, bridge support pivots, etc. Our 1.500 inch diameter and 1.750" diameter boring bars hold standard 1/2" square shank carbide lathe machine cutting tools. Our 1.250" diameter boring bars hold standard 3/8" square shank carbide lathe machine cutting tools. The bearing that is built into our Adapter Base bearing will hold the boring shaft load to prevent overloading the bearings in your mag drill. Since 2014 we now add extra mounting holes to allow an extra flange bearing to be bolted directly underneath. The Adapter Base also clamps the magnetic drill in case of power failure. A jacking screw is provided for positioning. Approved by Milwaukee Tool Company Engineers for use with their magnetic drill press. Available in 2 lengths depending upon what is the length of your magnetic base. Our boring bars are made from hard chrome plated induction hardened high tensile strength alloy steel to last a lifetime. Without a thick layer of chrome plating, your boring bar will need to be sanded and/or oiled regularly to prevent rust. The chrome is so hard it prevents scratches or scars on your shaft. The chrome also makes removing weld splatter super easy. That is why we sell only chrome plated boring shafts. No maintenance required. We also can supply .875, 1.00, 1.25 1.50 and 1.75 diameter boring bars separately. Prices do not include shipping cost. Most equipment is in stock and ships the next day or so.

                            ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES ! * ALWAYS KEEP HAIR, CLOTHING, HANDS AND FINGERS CLEAR! It helps to have a 2nd person to assist with the setup, especially when positioning your boring bar. This is intended for reboring pivot holes in heavy equipment such as cranes, backhoes, end loaders, excavators and tractors powered by your variable speed magnetic drill with a 3/4 inch [19mm] capacity drill chuck and a long drill press stroke. Our equipment can also be used to rebore holes on machinery side frames, mounting flanges, printing press frames, steel mill ladles, bridge pivots, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            1) When holes get egg shaped there is usually part of the hole that is not worn out and then you can reference off of the original hole diameter. Using two holes to repair, insert one plastic alignment cone (or metal sleeve for small holes or adjustable centering tools for very worn holes) against the good side of each worn hole. The further apart the holes are, the better. If using the line-up sleeves (for small holes), you can carefully wrap tape concentrically around the outer diameter of each sleeve for snug fit between the sleeve and the hole. It sounds strange but tape works. If the holes are too worn to find any of the original diameter to position the cone against, then you should use our optional centering-measuring tool set to position the boring bar.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            2) Slide the boring bar through each cone (or sleeve) and tighten the set screws in the cones. You can hold the cone &amp; boring bar up against the good side of the hole by using the bunge cord we provide.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            3) Bolt a self-aligning flange bearing to a bearing backup plate using bolts and washers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            4) Slide one bearing &amp; plate on one end of the boring bar and the drill base adapter (with built-in bearing) onto the other end the has the shank. Screw 4.5" riser blocks to bearing plates and to drill adapter base. Determine where riser blocks can be tack welded to connect bearing plates to equipment to be line-bored. The 4.5" inch riser blocks also allow easy removal of alignment cone and access for cutting tool positioning and measuring of the hole with the caliper (a flashlight helps to see). The 2" inch riser blocks can also be used vertically with the 4.5" inch risers if you need to get around a boss or a hydraulic line. One of the bearing plates is extra long in case you want to overhang a bearing at the end of what you are boring.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            5) Note: The optional BOA-408-AMT Bore Welder can screw into the drill base adapter or into the extra long bearing plate (instead of using the BOA-408 tack-weld positioning bracket).
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            6) Tack weld all stand-offs to heavy equipment to be line bored using many small tack welds to avoid warping. This especially true of the standoffs holding the adaptor for the drill.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            7) Undo set screws, slide boring bar part way out and remove the cones (or sleeves) from under the bearing plates.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            8) Using the shaft you can add more bearings where possible to prevent vibration during boring. We recommend one on each side of every hole you wish to bore (unless there are more than 2 holes). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            9) Make sure the shaft will slide back and forth inside the bearings. This is because after welding all the standoffs in place, the bearings will be seized on the shaft and it will be necessary to loosen the bolts that hold the bearings to the mounting plates. Then tap the boring bar slightly until you can slide the shaft back and forth because the welding process may have shifted things enough that the boring shaft does not want to slide through the bearings. The Adapter Base bearing position is permanent in order to protect the spindle bearing in the drill. This is required by Milwaukee to avoid hurting your warranty. The Milwaukee Drill Motor has 2 mounting positions. 1 with the Drill Chuck close to the Magnetic Drill Base and 1 with the Drill Chuck farther from the base. You normally want the Drill Motor bolted in the position where the Drill Chuck is closer to the Drill Base but either should be OK if you have the adjustable position base.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            10) Carefully position the magnetic drill in the adapter base using the jacking screw, and tighten the chuck of your magnetic drill onto the 3 flats of the shank of the boring bar while supporting the weight of the mag drill with the screws in the adapter base. It may be helpful to loosen and retighten the drill base swivel if your mag drill has it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bold-text">
                            Be careful not to bend the boring bar when installing the magnetic drill press. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            11) On the Safety Adapter Base; tighten the 4 side clamping bolts against the drill magnet base. In case of electrical power failure, such as blown fuse or so,eone trips over your extension cord, this is to help prevent the magnetic drill from injuring you and bending the shaft. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            12) Insert a standard lathe machine cutting tool into boring bar. Set screw the cutter in position to proper dimension for cutting. For adjusting, it helps to use one of our optional Cutting Tool Positioners shown near the bottom of this webpage. Otherwise you can use the digital caliper to measure from the tip of the cutter to the back side of the boring bar (see photo). You can also adjust your cutter position with a dial indicator. Then adjust the cutter out by the amount of change you set the caliper jaw for. Then tighten the set screw in the boring bar. Do not attempt to cut more than 1/32" [.78mm] off the diameter per pass thru. Less if the hole is large or if the hole is welded.
                        </p>

                            <img src="http://www.americanmachinetools.com/images/set_cutter_height.jpg" alt="Photo shows how you can adjust your boring cutter height with a dial caliper">

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            13) If you are boring thru weld, spray cutting fluid/oil often. If you cant find any, WD40 will still work, but beware that cutting oils will leave an oil residue. This matters if you bore before you weld. <b>You should remove oil residue before any welding to avoid oil hardening the weld. </b>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            14) Begin cutting at low RPMs. You should be able to remove up to 1/32" (1/64 per side) with each pass. Keep the carbide tool bits at low RPMs (100 rpm for 8" dia [200mm], 160 max rpm for 5" dia [125mm], 225 max rpm for 3.5" dia [87mm], 400 rpm max for 2" dia[50mm]). If the cutting tool is fighting hard, apply less pressure, to make the carbide cutting tools last longer. Check often to make sure the drill chuck is still tight on the shank. Vibration can loosen it. Also make sure you have a bearing located next to each hole to be rebored. <b>Do not install more than one cutter in the shaft at a time because you could overload the drill or the shank of the boring bar.</b>

                            15) The cobalt steel cutters are great for removing high spots from welded holes or for finishing. The left hand brazed carbide tools are for boring. A carbide facing tool and a carbide chamfering cutter are also included. The Borite holder with the carbide triangle insert is good for boring larger holes.

                            16) There are ususally three options to repair pivot holes on heavy equipment:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Holes can be welded and then bored back to the original specs. Unless you purchase a Bore Welder such as the BOA-408-AMT this is time consuming because it requires a lot of welding. Original Spec size is the hole diameter specified by the manufacturer (such as Caterpillar) to fit the pivot shaft, or if there is supposed to be a bushing, then spec size is the hole sized to press fit the bushing. Grind off or bore out galled metal first, because if you weld on top of galled metal, the weld will pull carbon from the galled metal and harden too much and you will waste many cutters and a lot of time trying to rebore the hard weld in the hole. Same advice goes for removing old grease and oil since they can oil harden the weld. Make sure you use the correct weld rod/wire for reboring with carbide cutting bits. 6011 rod is easier to machine than 7018 but wears faster. Consider 7014. For wire use 70S6 or substitute 70S2. If welding in cast steel then use a soft weld because it will harden and be hard to bore. If boring cast steel make sure to use C2 carbide instead of the C5 we give you. In welded holes it may help to first bore with the HSS cobalt steel cutter (instead of brittle carbide) to remove the high spots from hand welding. But you should use a hand grinder to grind smooth any high spots from the welds first.</li>
                            <li>Holes can be bored larger than spec size, and then a sleeve can be press fit or welded into the hole so that the I.D. is the original hole size (we recommend about 1/2" diameter larger for holes 2" to 4", 3/4" diameter larger for holes 4" to 6"). This method only works if the is a lot of extra room. The advantage of this method is that when the sleeve wears out you can just replace it without reboring.</li>
                            <li>An oversize bushing can be installed if there was a bushing before. Then when the holes become worn out again simply replace the bushing with a new one. An oversize bushing can be purchased from the manufacturer (such as Caterpillar) or are easily made on a <a href="http://www.americanmachinetools.com/lathe.htm">metal working lathe</a>. Heat treating the sleeve will make it last longer. Original Spec size is the original hole diameter specified by the manufacturer (such as Caterpillar) to fit the outer diameter of the pivot shaft, or if there is supposed to be a bushing, then spec size is the hole sized to press fit the outer diameter of the bushing that the shaft fits into. Check with the manufacturer for original specifications. Oversize bushings can be purchased from a heavy equipment dealer or sometimes an industrial bearing supplier such as one at the website <a href="www.ebushing.com">www.ebushing.com</a>. If your holes are not too worn and an oversize bushing is available, then you can just bore to fit the new larger outer diameter of the bushing. You can freeze some bushings overnight (or use nitrogen) and slip them into the holes in the morning for an easy press fit into a hole that is undersized by .001". Beware that the bushing I.D. does not collapse in so much that you need to bore or hone the I.D. to fit the pin.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            17) Stop to measure the hole after each pass through and adjust your cutter as specified above in paragraph 12. You will likely need to sharpen or switch cutters at least once (if it did not break). To measure the hole, use the telescoping bore gauge set or the dial caliper with jaw extensions provided (see photo). The jaw extensions allow you to measure the hole diameter without removing the shaft. But the jaw extensions will change the size that the caliper dial reads by .15 inches so it helps to measure across the jaw extension pins with another caliper to find out the actual hole size. The optional snap gauge set or adjustable threaded measuring tools allow you to measure the bore without removing the boring bar and so does the caliper extenders. The best way to get the most exact finish is to hone the last .001 inch (see photo). This also reduces the risk of accidentally boring too much. A hone with 80 grit or 100 grit honing stones is good for this. But 220 grit stones will take all day. Scroll down below to see more about this option.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            18) When holes are finish sized, remove Magnetic drill and all bearing mounting plates but leave bearings bolted on tight until you are sure that the holes are perfect. The flat head screws in the bearing plates go into countersunk screw holes that are designed for easy re-assembly back together in the exact same positions if you tighten them down 90 percent of the way and then tighten the last 10 percent of the way a 1/4 turn per each screw until they are gradually all tight on the standoffs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            19) When you are sure that the holes are perfect carefully use a torch and hand grinder to remove bearing standoff plates for future use or leave them on until you are absolutely sure you are done. It is best to remove the standoffs only after you are sure the holes are perfect just in case you want to reassemble the equipment and line bore one last pass through the holes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            20) If you are careful you should use about 1 or 2 carbide cutters per hole. Welded holes are hard on cutters. Carbide is hard enough to cut weld but also brittle so it can chip or break easy. Consider starting each hole with the plain cobalt-steel cutter to clean out the rough/high spots before using a carbide cutter. The plain cobalt-steel cutters dont chip or break, they just get dull quickly but they are easy to sharpen and easy to use when you are starting out.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            21) Our standard Q150 equipment can bore up to 5.5" diameter (6" for the Q175) but be aware that extending the cutting tool bit out very far increases unwanted vibration (tool chatter). If you get a lot of vibration then you should read our webpage <a href="http://www.americanmachinetools.com/reduce_cutting_tool_chatter.htm">How to Reduce Cutting Tool Chatter</a>. To reduce cutter vibration in holes 3.5 to 6 inches [87 to 150mm] you can buy the optional slotted clamping collar set. To bore holes larger than 5 inches, it is better to use the optional oversize adapter which allows hole boring up to 8 inches. The adapter slides on the boring bar and is designed to be screwed into one of the threaded holes that normally hold a set screw. The cutting bit can then be used inside the adapter to bore up to 8" diameter. The optional adapter comes with cones that taper from 5" to 8" diameter and longer bearing mounting plates to bridge over 8" holes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            <b>NOTE:</b> The carbide tips can be modified or sharpened with a green silicon grinding wheel or diamond grinding wheel mounted on a bench/pedestal grinder. Grinding the relief angle of the carbide further back can help reduce cutting tool chatter. The colbalt steel cutters can be sharpened on any stationary grinding wheel. All the cutting bits shipped with the line boring equipment are full length stock size, so that each tool is capable of cutting to its maximum diameter. To bore holes smaller than 3.5" diameter, cut the shank of a cutting tool bit with a hack saw. To bore holes smaller than 2", you may need to grind back some of the cutting tool head so that it can fit further down into the square tool hole on the boring shaft. Our Q150 and Q175 equipment uses standard 1/2" square lathe carbide cutting tools. We provide a indexable tool holder with triangle carbide inserts, carbide boring cutters, colbalt steel boring cutters, carbide chamfering cutter, and carbide facing cutter that faces a circular path about 5/8" wide and can be used to face multiple concentric paths. You could also consider using a portable belt sander for surface facing or our optional facing-sanding disc that mounts on the boring shaft. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            <b>Need to cut a retaining ring groove?</b> Buy our optional retaining ring groove cutting kit. It has everything you need to cut standard width snap ring grooves with our Q150 boring shafts. If you cant afford to buy the optional kit you could try a crude method to cut snap ring grooves. Grind the tip of a cobalt steel cutter to match the width of the groove to cut. Mount a set screw collar on your cutter and use a spring to push outward against the collar. Push the cutter down into the boring bar while you position the cutter to where you want the groove. Tighten a bearing set screw against the boring bar to hold the position. Then release the cutter and use very slow rpms to cut the groove. This method can work for holes over 4 inches diameter. It is a very crude way to cut a retaining ring groove but it can work.
